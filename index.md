# Code is Science Manifesto

Through working with scientific code, we agree that scientific code needs to be treated as a genuine research output. For this reason we have created a [manifesto](manifesto.md), which will allow both individuals and organisations to sign up and agree to make genuine efforts to both make their own scientific code open, as well as sharing the manifesto mission with others. 

## How can I contribute? 

Right now, we're looking for feedback about the text of the manifesto, although we're hopeful that it's pretty close to the final thing. You can also look at the [issues](https://github.com/codeisscience/manifesto/issues/) on github and see if there's anything else you can pick up. You can also look at our [roadmap](roadmap.md) to get an understanding of our timeline.
