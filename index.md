# Code is Science Manifesto

Through working with scientific code, we agree that scientific code needs to be treated as a genuine research output. For this reason we have created a [manifesto](manifesto.md), which will allow both individuals and organisations to sign up and agree to make genuine efforts to both make their own scientific code open, as well as sharing the manifesto mission with others. 

## I want to express my support for the manifesto! Tell me how

[Sign the manifesto as an individual]()

 We're particularly interested in adding logos and links indicating organisational support from publishers, funders, and research institutions.
